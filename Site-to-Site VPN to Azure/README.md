# Site to Site VPN Connection

This template will create a Virtual Network, a subnet for the network, a Virtual Network Gateway and a Connection to your network outside of Azure (defined as your `local` network). This could be anything such as your on-premises network and can even be used with other cloud networks.

Please note that you must have a Public IP for your other network's VPN gateway and cannot be behind an NAT.
